Java Prohgramming using Constructor and Overloading

1) Write an application that declares the classname "sphere". 
It should have instance variable to recall its radius and the cordinates of its centers.
This should be of type "double". Use the new operator to create a sphere object and display its instance variable.
	a) Using default constructor
	b) Using argument constructor

2) In problem 1. add two methods and find find Area and find Volume.
Take one variable "radius" as "double" to display the surface area and volume of the sphare using argument constructor

3) Write a program that simply prints "Wonder of objects" without using any 
print statement .concrete method or "." inside the main method.

4) Write an application that accepts one command line argument and display itsspanish equivalent. 
For example, "UNO","dos","tres", "quarto" and "cinco" are the spanish tokens 
for the number from "one" through "five".
Create a class with static method to accomplish this task.

5) WAP that has an overloaded method. The first method should accept no arguments.
The second method should accept a string and the third method will accept a string and an integer.
The first method should display "Welcome to JAVA".
The second method should display "Welcome to Polymorphism" twice and the third method should display "Welcome to overloading" trice

6) WAP to to define a class shape within the class shape define the three constructors; one for computing the Area of the triangel,
other for Reactangle and the last one for the square.
Using constructor overloading, display the area of Triangle, rectangle and square without defining any methods.

7) Write an application that creates ten rock object and saves these in an array. Randomly select a mass
between 1 and 10 kg for each rock as it created.
After all rocks have been created, display there individual mass and total mass of all rocks.
